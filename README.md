# RTAC
Coding challenge involving the implementation of real-time audio convolution in JUCE

Instructions/notes:

1) The folder consists of Matlab codes for 5.1 real time audio convolution
2) file-01 to file-06 are the FL, FR, C, LFE, RL, RR audio channels
3) Also attached are hrir file in .mat format for the corresponding locations
4) This matlab code is written using the real-time audio toolbox in matlab
5) Run “realtimeaudioConvolution_5p1_HRIRs.mlx”
